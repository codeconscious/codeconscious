### Welcome!

This is a small workshop where I occasionally upload small toolsâ€”sometimes for fun, sometimes to learn, sometimes to solve a problem, but generally for some mix of these. I particularly enjoy working with .NET and C# to make cross-platform CLI tools, so most of my work will likely leverage that technology in some way. (I work with .NET Framework and .NET 6 in my day job.)
